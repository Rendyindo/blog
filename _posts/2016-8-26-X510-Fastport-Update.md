Well, this is my first post here.

Being "Hello World" is too mainstream :p

so, just go to the point.

A new update for X510 Fastport!

So whats new?

Well, just.. an option .-.

Anyway it still important!

The option i add is, "Port system folder"

Why?

couse why you need to extract system.img, but the file not there? just only system folder? That will spam the window with "The system cannot find the path specified" right?

Well, i hate That!

So the new update will get rid of it.

AND.

A same chipset port for 6.0!

_*Thanks for @iykequame for tutorial_
